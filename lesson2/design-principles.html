            <h3>Contrast</h3>
            <div>
                Ibanez Guitars
                <br>

                <p>The Ibanez website looks great. Here is an excellent example demonstrating the design
                    principle of
                    contrast. The white font really pops on top of the attractive, darker background.</p>

            <h3>Fitt's Law</h3>
            <div>
                The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints
                <br>
                <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/">churchofjesuschrist.org</a>
                <img src="images/church.jpg" alt="Church website showing Fitt's law design principle" />
                <p>Fitt's law predicts that the time required to move to a target area is a function of the
                    ratio between the distance to the target and the width
                    of the target. The design of The Church Of Jesus Christ Of Latter Days Saints website takes
                    this into account. On the website there are several articles you can navigate to, scrolling
                    from
                    the top down. Each large square image is actually a clickable button which links the to the
                    articles.
                    This makes the website very easy to use, and it works well on a mobile device.</p>

            <h3>Alignment</h3>
            <div>
                Gibson Brands
                <br>
                <br>
                <a href="https://www.gibson.com/">gibson.com</a>
                <img src="images/gibson.jpg" alt="Gibson website showing alignment design principle" />
                <p>In addition to using the design concepts of negative space and proximity, the Gibson
                    website uses both vertical and horizontal alignment. The result is a well organized,
                    attractive
                    layout that provides a great user experience.</p>
